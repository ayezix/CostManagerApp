/*
 * index.js - Application Entry Point
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¯ What this does (for students):
 * This is the entry point that starts our React app.
 * It finds the div with id="root" in index.html and renders our App component there.
 * 
 * ðŸ“š Key Learning Concepts:
 * - ReactDOM.createRoot(): Modern way to mount React apps
 * - React.StrictMode: Helps catch common mistakes during development
 * - Entry Point: Where the application starts executing

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
